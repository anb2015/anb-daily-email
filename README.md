# anb-daily-email
A plain-text email sent to subscribers which details their weather and includes trivia questions, et al.

Version 3.0 I removed joke functionality as some of the jokes were not family-friendly, even with parameters set to filter out unwanted content.

I started coding about 7 months ago.

This is my second project -- and the first I've broken into modules.

It runs thanks to the Tasks feature on PythonAnywhere, https://www.pythonanywhere.com/

API's employed:
Open Weather, https://openweathermap.org/api
Open Trivia Database, https://opentdb.com/api_config.php
Sunrise Sunset, https://sunrise-sunset.org/api
icanhazdadjoke: https://icanhazdadjoke.com

I am greatly appreciative to my subscribers and to the aforementioned services.
Andrew
